# Mechan is glad to greet you, desu!
Mechan is a telegram bot. Unlike most of bots, she doesn't use bot API \- instead she uses [tdlib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib) which allows her to look like a human. She is my masterpiece, gathering all the best of [Ironic](https://github.com/Meta-chan/ironic_library) and other my projects.

### Building
- 1) Clone this repository.
- 2) Install [Ironic Library](https://github.com/Meta-chan/ironic_library).
- 3) Download [Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/145HLT_S2EaRzAvD0R1s121Do4rLAN5V9?usp=sharing) and move them to `data` subdirectory.
- 4) Install [tdlib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib).
- 5) Enter Visual Studio command prompt by entering `vsdevcmd` or `vsdevcmd -arch=amd64` dependent on your bitness. Remember that you may need to call `vsdevcmd` directly or add it's location to `PATH`.
- 6) Run `nmake`

Note: I guarantee nothing. There might be problems with installation and usage of `tdlib`, it's interface continues changing. Use your programming skills to fix it.
